                    <p>It is a website help users to sign up. Connect with their friends and family members.
                     You can upload a post. Update it and you can also delete it. It even allows you to upload a profile pic.</p>

        <div class="p-2">
            <div class="p2-d">
                <p>It was a project made by me just for fun. It is like the popular websites like facebook and instagram but It's not
                that popular obviously. It almost took me a month to built as It was very complicated and I was working on this big project alone.
                To be very honest It was very informative working on this project as I learnt many things working. It was a big project and I personally think I handeled It well.
                I did everything for this website. No matter If its Frontend, Backend, Databases, Design or Logo design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p2-d">
                <p>So talking about this website I must share that what you can do with it. Because It has a strong backend, frontend and design that's why it consist of many great features.
                Like a login and registeration form. If you have created your account you just have to go to login page and just login but If you don't have then you first have to create which will afterward be saved in the database.
                Let's first talk about the registration form. So like Facebook and Instagram in this website you can also set a profile pic. Which is a cool thing after all. But in registration form you don't give a profile pic. It would be set as default pic which is a weird one but works well.
                And if you want to change the profile pic you can change it by going in the account settings and giving an image file to the website and it will be set.</p>

            <div class="top-sp p2-d">
                <p>Talking about the website You can see the front end work is done very well by me. It's done within HTML and CSS.
